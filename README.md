# UX-UI-App-Prototype
-Design an interactive app prototype 
-Choose an app of your interest and redesign a high-fidelity prototype of it in Figma to incorporate: 

-The design principles discussed during the course of this module for the overall design.
Clean page and element structure,  solid interaction design
You must redevelop the app's layout and design yourself, and then build the necessary screens that you would encounter when using the application. Keep the same purpose of the original app intact, redesigning the brand logo, the layout and the colour palette. You can choose to develop your own original app concept if you want.
 You will be evaluated on visual design, the usability and the perceived user experience of your app concept.

# # Your UI should be clean and consistent between screens, meaning:

-Even spacing/padding between elements
-Consistent colour palette
-Icons and Navigation elements should share style
-Uniform font and typography
